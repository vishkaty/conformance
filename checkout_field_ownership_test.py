"""Structural conformance tests for checkout server-owned fields.

``checkout.json`` marks ``continue_url``, ``expires_at``, ``messages``, and
``order`` with ``"ucp_request": "omit"`` -- the schema-authoring vocabulary
that excludes a field from every request variant (create and update) while
keeping it on the response. These four members exist only so the business
can communicate state back to the caller; a caller has no schema-legal way
to set them, and a compliant create handler that builds the response by
merging or spreading the raw request body must still not let a value the
caller supplied for one of these members reach either the response or the
stored checkout.

This module sends a caller payload that stuffs values into all four members
anyway (bypassing the SDK request model, which has no fields for them, by
posting a raw JSON body -- exactly what an uncooperative or buggy client can
do) and asserts the values the business itself set come back instead, both
in the create response and when the session is read back afterward.
